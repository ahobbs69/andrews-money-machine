## CFA Survey Project

### What Worked
- Built Python + Playwright backend (backend.py)
- Found acinf Python library for AC Infinity Controller 69
- Chick-fil-A files at ~/Desktop/CFA/

### What Didn't Work
- **All automated browser approaches failed:**
  - Chrome headless - blocked
  - Chrome headed - blocked  
  - Firefox (Playwright) - blocked
  - WebKit/Safari - blocked
- CFA has enterprise-grade JS challenge protection that detects all automation

### Files Created
- `/Users/hobbs/Desktop/CFA/backend.py` - Flask + Playwright (doesn't work)
- `/Users/hobbs/Desktop/CFA/server.js` - Express + Puppeteer (doesn't work)
- `/Users/hobbs/Desktop/CFA/server-headed.js` - Headed Chrome (doesn't work)
- `/Users/hobbs/Desktop/CFA/server-firefox.js` - Firefox (doesn't work)
- `/Users/hobbs/Desktop/CFA/server-webkit.js` - WebKit (doesn't work)

### Current Status
- **Manual token capture** is the only reliable option
- Need user to manually open browser, get survey token from URL
- Then use that token for validation

### Next Steps
- Offer manual token capture setup
- OR switch to AC Infinity controller (different project)
