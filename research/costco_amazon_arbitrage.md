## Tips for Finding Deals at Costco

### 1. Timing Strategies
- **Wednesday/Thursday:** New markdowns typically posted
- **Holiday weekends:** Major sales events (Memorial Day, July 4th, Black Friday)
- **End of quarter:** Clearance opportunities increase
- **January:** Post-holiday clearance

### 2. What to Look For
- **Kirkland Signature items:** Often 20-40% cheaper than brand names
- **Bulk packaging:** Multi-packs resell well (diapers, wipes, snacks)
- **Seasonal transitions:** Spring → Summer → Fall → Holiday clearances
- **"While Supplies Last" items:** Often priced to move quickly

### 3. Sourcing Tools
- **Costco App:** Shows in-stock and pricing at local warehouses
- **Costco.com:** Browse without membership (limited)
- **The Costco Connection:** Monthly magazine with featured deals
- **BrickSeek (nowpart.com):** Check inventory at local stores

### 4. Profitable Patterns
- Multi-packs of consumables → Individual units on Amazon
- Bundle deals → Break apart and sell components
- Member-only pricing vs. Amazon Marketplace prices
- Kirkland Signature = Amazon competitors often don't carry it

---

## Legal Considerations

### Generally Safe:
- Most consumer goods are legal to resell
- No restrictions on unopened, non-regulated items
- Amazon allows reselling most retail products

### Requires Caution:
- **Expiration dates:** Must have adequate shelf life (90+ days minimum)
- **Hazmat items:** Some beauty/personal care have restrictions
- **Gated categories:** Some require approval (beauty, grocery, supplements)
- **Brand restrictions:** Some brands prohibit MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) violations
- **Counterfeit concerns:** Only sell authentic products with proper receipts

## Conclusion

Costco to Amazon retail arbitrage remains profitable in 2026, but success requires:

1. **Focus on consumables** with repeat purchase potential
2. **Calculate true profits** after ALL fees (not just referral fees)
3. **Start small** with lower-risk categories (vitamins, baby, pet supplies)
4. **Track inventory carefully** to avoid long-term storage fees
5. **Build relationships** with specific product categories

**Recommended Starting Point:**
Begin with vitamins/supplements and baby products. These categories have:
- High sales velocity
- Predictable demand
- Repeat purchase potential
- Manageable margins
- Low return rates

**Expected Timeline to Profitability:**
- Month 1-2: Learning curve, sourcing strategy development
